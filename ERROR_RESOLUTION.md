# ✅ FIXED: Missing Required Error Components

## 🐛 Problem Identified:
**"Missing required error components, refreshing..."** and **Internal Server Error** when navigating to Properties, Analytics, and Settings pages.

## 🔍 Root Cause:
The **Header component was missing** from the main pages. When we previously fixed the "double header" issue by removing the Header from `layout.tsx`, we forgot to add it individually to each page that needed it.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied:

### Files Updated:
1. **`src/app/properties/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added `import Header from '@/components/Header'`
   - ✅ Added `<Header />` component to JSX

2. **`src/app/analytics/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added `import Header from '@/components/Header'`
   - ✅ Added `<Header />` component to JSX

3. **`src/app/settings/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added `import Header from '@/components/Header'`
   - ✅ Added `<Header />` component to JSX

## ✅ Current Status:

### Server Output:
```
✓ Compiled /properties in 869ms (630 modules)
